Tweets Extraction- To explore the influence of Twitter sentiment on cryptocurrency prices, this study identified the top 100 crypto influencers using sources like Crypto.com, Cryptoweekly, and Investopedia. Tweets from 91 active influencer accounts were extracted using Python’s Tweepy API, capturing details like tweet content, timestamp, likes, retweets, hashtags, and follower counts. Due to Twitter API limitations, tweets were collected across the full date range. Concurrently, cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple was retrieved using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance), including daily closing prices, market cap, and volume. This integrated dataset of social sentiment and market data enabled a robust foundation for analyzing potential correlations and building predictive models.

Tweets VADER EDA- To ensure accurate sentiment analysis, the tweets underwent extensive preprocessing. Noise such as URLs, mentions, hashtags, extra spaces, non-ASCII characters, and punctuation were removed. Text was converted to lowercase, stopwords were eliminated, and lemmatization was applied to standardize the vocabulary. Tweets were filtered to a 3-month date range (March 27–May 31, 2023) and refined using a custom Bag of Words of 615 finance- and crypto-related terms to retain only relevant tweets. VADER, a lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool, was used to assign polarity scores (ranging from -1 to +1). In addition to these compound scores, a weighted final score was calculated to reflect influencer impact using follower count, likes, and retweets. This score was then normalized using MinMaxScaler for use in predictive modeling.

Crypto EDA- The analysis examined cryptocurrency price data from March 28 to May 31, 2023, showing Bitcoin prices ranged between $20,187 and $30,485, Ethereum from $1,429 to $2,120, and Ripple from $0.36 to $0.54. A detailed exploratory analysis of tweets from various influencers revealed an average of 153 tweets per influencer, confirming the dataset’s robustness. Tweets tended to be concise, averaging between 50 to 100 characters. Engagement metrics such as retweets and likes showed a positive skew, with most tweets receiving low engagement (median around 10), while a few achieved very high interaction. Tweet volume remained stable over time, peaking midweek, especially on Wednesdays, and lowest on Sundays, likely reflecting strategic posting patterns. Top influencers by tweet volume included CoinMarketCap, while Jack Dorsey led in average likes and retweets, showing that high tweet volume does not necessarily equate to high engagement. Engagement rate analysis highlighted that some influencers with fewer followers, like Polychain, had higher engagement rates, indicating more resonant content. A word cloud revealed that discussions centered on terms like “Bitcoin,” “Ethereum,” “DeFi,” “blockchain,” and “NFT,” indicating a focus on major cryptocurrencies and related technologies. Finally, topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) identified ten key topics across the tweets, offering deeper insight into trending themes within the cryptocurrency discourse.

Bitcoin_final/etherum_final/ripple_final- The data for training covers 72 days from March 2 to May 12, 2023, while the test period spans 19 days from May 13 to May 31, 2023. Models with prediction accuracy below 50% were discarded, as they lack reliability for future investment decisions. Predictions were evaluated using error metrics like RMSE and MAE, with RMSE being more sensitive to outliers—important for volatile cryptocurrency prices. For Bitcoin, Bi-LSTM and XGBoost exceeded 50% accuracy, with Bi-LSTM showing better RMSE, likely due to its ability to capture temporal dependencies and non-linear relationships. For Ethereum, XGBoost and Holt’s Winter models surpassed 50% accuracy, with XGBoost outperforming Bi-LSTM in RMSE, suggesting its effectiveness in handling complex variables. Ripple’s predictions were more accurate across models, except for XGBoost; Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieved the highest accuracy (around 58%) and the lowest RMSE, highlighting its suitability for highly volatile Ripple price predictions.

Mail Content- The message body first calculates several key values before sending daily updates: (a) Sentiment Scores, which measure the percentage change from the previous day; (b) Predicted Prices, also expressed as percentage differences from the prior day; (c) Predicted Price Range, determined using statistical methods including sample size, standard deviation, standard error, and a 95% confidence interval to estimate upper and lower bounds; and (d) Predicted Direction, a flag indicating whether sentiment scores and prices are moving up or down. Based on this direction, the message outputs either a "sell" signal with a predicted price increase or a "buy" signal with a predicted price decrease, including the expected percentage change and price range.
